To solve these issues, always ensure units are compatible (pixels with pixels, percentages with percentages, etc.).  For nested calculations, break them down into intermediate variables to improve readability and ensure accurate calculations.  For percentage subtractions, consider using relative units (like `em` or `rem`) or provide explicit pixel values to make the calculation less ambiguous. For example:

```css
/* Problematic */
width: calc(100% - 10%);

/* Solution 1: Use em/rem or provide explicit pixel values */
width: calc(100% - 20px); /* Assuming 20px is equivalent to 10% in your context */
width: calc(100vw - 10vw); /* Using view width for better relative calculation */

/* Solution 2: Break down nested expressions into intermediate variables */
:root {
  --sidebar-width: 200px;
}

.content {
  width: calc(100% - var(--sidebar-width));
}
```
By addressing these points, you'll avoid many common `calc()` issues and ensure your CSS layouts render as intended.
