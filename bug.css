The CSS property `calc()` can sometimes lead to unexpected results if you're not careful with operator precedence and unit compatibility. For example, `width: calc(100% - 10px);` works fine, but `width: calc(100% - 10%);` might not render as expected because you're subtracting a percentage from a percentage, and the reference point for the percentage is ambiguous.  Another issue is with nested `calc()` expressions; making sure that the units align correctly within nested calculations is essential to avoid rendering issues.
